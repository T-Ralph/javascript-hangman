# JavaScript Assignment - Hangman by T-Ralph

## Requirements
- User is presented with a word they must guess for, but the word is only shown with underscores instead of letters so that “p r o g r a m m i n g” appears as “_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _”
- The user may guess a letter by typing in the letter and clicking on the Guess button
    - If the word contains that letter, then the letter will appear in the Word section.
        - I.e.: User guesses ‘m’ so the word appears as “_ _ _ _ _ _ m m _ _ _”
    - If the word does not contain the letter, then the letter will appear in the Previous Guesses section and the Chances will go down by one.
- If the user runs out of chances then they lose.
- If the user guesses the whole word and there are no more underscores shown on the screen, then the user wins!When the game is over, the user will be allowed to play a new game with a different word to guess.

## Challenges
Add any of the following features:
- Make guesses case-insensitive
- CSS and C.A.R.P. principles are used to make a nice design
- Make the game two-player where each player has their own chances
- Use html and css to draw an actual hangman or display images of the hangman:
